Creating react app

1-first check with node -v
2-connect with infosys network
3-npm install -g create-react-app
4-create-react-app my-app
5- now start you app by npm start
6- our program is executed from  src/index.js 
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);​​​​​​​

7-ReactDOM.render is used to render an element or component to the virtual DOM.

The first argument specifies what needs to be rendered
The second argument specifies where to render.
The root element is present inside index.html

8- <body>
    <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
    <div id="root"></div>
</body>

9- i can also render using 
ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello React!<h1/>, document.getElementById('root'));

10-React.StrictMode, component does not render any visible UI

11- if you work with db.json for that you need to run this file by using command 
json-server --watch db.json --port 4000

12 - A React component is the fundamental unit of any React application. They are capable of encapsulating data and view as a single unit.
 These components can work in conjunction with each other.
Components make code reusable, testing easy, and can take care of separation of concerns.
The capability of creating own components is a major productivity boost to any web application development. 
Here, in ReactJS, components reside in virtual DOM and these components will be available as nodes in actual DOM.

                                        How to create a React component?
13 - There are 2 types of components that can be created in React
1. Class based components
2. Functional components
In this course, you will be learning about functional components

14- Functional Components
•    Created as a simple JavaScript function
•    It just returns the HTML elements
The functional component can be created as follows:

import React from 'react';
function App() {
    return React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello World!!!");
}
export default App;
 

App - The component name should be in Pascal Casing
React.createElement - helps to create an element in plain JavaScript

15 - To display elements of a component, the component must be rendered.
For rendering a component, ReactDOM.render method is used as follows:
Syntax:
ReactDOM.render(<parameter 1/>, parameter 2); 
ReactDOM.render method will take 2 parameters:

'parameter 1' is the name of the component to be rendered
'parameter 2' is the HTML node reference where the component to be rendered
 
16 - 1. React allows developers to create 2 types of components
     a. Class components
     b. Functional components
2. Functional components are javascript functions which returns HTML elements using React.createElement method
3. The component can be rendered to the DOM using ReactDOM.render method

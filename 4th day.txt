				// Why Props and State?

1 - What is State?
State is a JavaScript object used to manage the data of an application
To associate state with components you can use useState hook

2 - const [count, setCount] = useState(0); 
useState() is a function which takes ‘initialState’ as the initial value for any state variable and returns 2 values.
In the above code snippet, count is a state variable which is initialized with value 0 and setCount is the function 
used to update the state count 

3 - 
//   import {useState} from 'react';
// function App() {
//   const [name,setName] = useState("Jack")
//  const handler = ()=>{
//   setName("Saurabh");
// }
//   return (
//     <div>
//       Your Name is: {name}<br/>
//       <button onClick={handler}>Change</button>
//     </div>
//   );
// }
// export default App;

4 -Key points to be remembered while handling data in a component:
States are mutable 
They are reserved for interactivity. The component's event handlers may update the state and trigger a UI update
The state will be set with a default value when component mounts and will mutate in time based on user events 
generated

5 - import React, { useState } from "react";
import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
const Employees = () => {
  const [employees, setEmployees] = useState([
    { empId: 1234, name: "John", designation: "SE" },
    { empId: 4567, name: "Tom", designation: "SSE" },
    { empId: 8910, name: "Kevin", designation: "TA" },
  ]);
  const addEmployee = () => {
    setEmployees([
      ...employees,    ///////-> this line ans these ... is important to update the values in employeees
      { empId: 6789, name: "Sam", designation: "TL" },
    ]);
  };
  return (
    <>
      <table style={{ width: "60%" }} className="table">
        <thead className="thead-light">
          <tr>
            <th>EmpID</th>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Designation</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          {employees.map((employee) => {
            return (
              <tr>
                <td>{employee.empId}</td>
                <td>{employee.name}</td>
                <td>{employee.designation}</td>
              </tr>
            );
          })}
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <button className="btn btn-primary" onClick={addEmployee}>Add an Employee</button>
    </>
  );
}
export default Employees;

				//How to use props

6 - When you want to pass data from parent component to child component, it can be achieved using props.
How to pass and access props?
<App data= {10} />
Here, the property 'data' with a value '10' is passed to the component App.
The props are passed as arguments to functional components and can be accessed within the components as shown below..
